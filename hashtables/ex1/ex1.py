# Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item
# weights, implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` that finds
# two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. Your
# function will return a tuple of integers that has the following form:

# ```
# (zero, one)
# ```

# where each element represents the item weights of the two packages.
# _**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index and
# the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.**_ If such a
# pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return
# `None`.
# Your solution should run in linear time.
